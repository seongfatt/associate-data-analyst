I'm a junior data analyst who recently completed the NTUC Associate Data Analyst program (June 2025). I'm building a strong foundation in data visualization, machine learning, and AI-assisted productivity.

🤖 How Gen AI Helped Me Build This Project
As a new data analyst, I used Gen AI tools (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude) to:

Understand how to structure SQL queries for business questions
Choose the right chart types for different metrics
Debug Excel formulas and Power BI DAX expressions
Write clear documentation and project summaries
This doesn’t make me “less” of an analyst — it makes me a modern one.
I focus on understanding the problem, validating the output, and delivering value — with AI as my assistant, not my replacement.
